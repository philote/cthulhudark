# How to use the system locally

With the change to LevelDB, there is an extra step to create the packs locally.

- Clone the repository as usual
- You need to have a node.js installation done
- run `npm install`: will generate the node_modules depending on package.json and package-lock.json
- then `npm run build` to build once or `npm run watch` to have a SCSS watcher running to update the CSS when SCSS is updated automatically.
- If you want Foundry to hot-reload pages as you make updates, you will need to launch Foundry with the `--hotReload` flag. See [Using Command Line Flags](https://foundryvtt.com/article/configuration/)
- `npm run createSymlinks` - Create development symlinks for improved intellisense
    - You will need to update `example-foundry-config.yaml` & `example-jsconfig.json`
